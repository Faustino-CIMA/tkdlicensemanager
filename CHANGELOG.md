# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### User-facing
- Fixed member photo uploads that previously failed with generic errors.
- Fixed cases where a photo saved successfully but did not display afterward.
- Improved upload failure messages, including clearer feedback for server and size-related failures.

### Technical
- Hardened backend photo processing and storage flow to tolerate partial derivative write failures while preserving required processed image saves.
- Increased upload-size limits and made frontend multipart uploads size-aware by skipping oversized optional original files.
- Added authenticated API endpoints for processed and thumbnail profile images to avoid reliance on direct `/media` routing.
- Improved container startup permission handling for media, static, and Celery beat storage paths in Docker Compose deployments.
